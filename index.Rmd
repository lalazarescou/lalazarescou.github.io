## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### A little info about me:
I'm an experienced technology professional and budding data scientist in the MS in Data Science Program at SMU.
Learning R, SAS and all kinds of crazy statistical concepts is humbling, but it will put me 
at the intersection of the Data Science Venn Diagram.

I was born in Dallas, TX where I now live (very rare in Dallas).
I attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a BS in Petroleum Engineering.
As fate would have it, oil was $9 / barrel when I graduated so I was lucky to get a job but we were 
very very bored - waiting for oil to hit $20/barrel so we could "make economics".

After a few twists and turns I jumped on the early wave of the data revolution and joined Oracle Consulting, 
designing and implementing new applications on relational database.

Today I work for Microsoft, helping customers achieve their business objectives with Microsoft technologies.
Ironically I'm not an Azure expert (yet). In fact, I've been in consultative technical sales for the greater
part of my career, so this is an adventure back to the land of techies.  

My new skills are still pretty rough, but I find that even though we have developed a lot of 
new technologies, the principles are still very similar to my earlier tech days.
In the future, I look forward to applying my industry knowledge, updated coding skills and 
architectural experience to helping non-profits and public sector organizations transform.

Take a look at my first projects that will make me smile in a few years:
